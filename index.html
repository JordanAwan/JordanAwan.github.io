      <h3> Education </h3>
      <article>
	I studied at Clarion University from 2011-2014, earning a B.S. in mathematics. After this, I completed a M.A. in Mathematics at Brandeis University in 2016 under the advisement of Dr. Olivier Bernardi.

	Currently I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Penn State University, advised by Dr. Aleksandra Slavkovic and Dr. Matthew Reimherr.

      <h3> Research Interests</h3>
      <article>
	My research focuses on differential privacy, with applications to functional data analysis, classical statistical inference, and empirical risk minimization. I also have collaborated with my father Dr. Shaheen Awan, Professor of Speech Pathology at Bloomsburg University, in problems of pitch tracking for the analysis of physiological signals.
