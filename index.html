<h3> Research Interests</h3>

My research focuses on differential privacy, with applications to functional data analysis, classical statistical inference, and empirical risk minimization. I also have collaborated with my father Dr. Shaheen Awan, Professor of Speech Pathology at Bloomsburg University, in problems of pitch tracking for the analysis of physiological signals.
